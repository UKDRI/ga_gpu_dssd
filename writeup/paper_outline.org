* Abstract
- Background :: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, yet these cells do not fail in a uniform manner. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals high heterogeneity, but identifying robust, combinatorial gene signatures that define *distinct neuronal failure modes* remains a computational challenge.
- Methodology :: We applied Diverse Subgroup Set Discovery (DSSD) to this problem, modeling neuronal heterogeneity as a collection of distinct rules. To navigate the vast search space, we developed a *Hierarchical Parallel Genetic Algorithm*. The framework deployed 100 GPU nodes, with each node simultaneously executing 10 independent search instances via tensor batching.
- Rigor :: We strictly enforced an *"Equal Computational Effort"* principle. We performed a massive-scale permutation test where the real dataset and 999 randomized datasets were each subjected to exactly *72 hours* of rapid-cycle evolutionary search (population 55, restarting every 300 generations).
- Results :: The framework executed a deep search equivalent to ~72,000 hours of sequential computation. It identified a combinatorial gene signature in PD dopaminergic neurons with a fitness score that was statistically unreachable by chance ($p < 0.001$). This signature defines a robust, non-overlapping cell state distinct from general stress responses.
- Conclusion :: This study demonstrates that DSSD, powered by parallel GPU computing and rigorous statistics, is a powerful paradigm for untangling the heterogeneity of dopaminergic neurodegeneration.

* Introduction
** The Biological Challenge: The "Mixed Bag" of PD Neurons
- Parkinson's Disease primarily affects dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, but degeneration is asynchronous and heterogeneous.
- *The Core Hypothesis:* "Non-overlapping subgroups" in scRNA-seq data correspond to *distinct neuronal states* or molecular failure modes (e.g., mitochondrial collapse vs. synaptic dysfunction).

** The Computational Challenge
- *The Search Space:* Finding the specific combinations of genes that define these states requires searching an astronomically large solution space ($2^{1000}$ combinations).
- *The Interpretability Gap:* "Black box" AI can classify PD neurons but cannot explain the underlying molecular mechanisms.
- *The Solution:* Diverse Subgroup Set Discovery (DSSD) generates interpretable "IF-THEN" rules, but validating them requires immense compute power to distinguish true biological signal from noise.

** Our Approach: Parallel DSSD on GPUs
- We present a framework that treats identifying PD cell states as a massive combinatorial optimization problem.
- *Parallelism as an Enabler:* We combine the population-based search of Genetic Algorithms with the tensor throughput of GPUs to solve the computational bottleneck.

* Methods
** Single-Cell Data Preprocessing
- *Dataset:* 6,385 dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra (Control vs. PD).
- *Normalization:* =SCTransform= with strict batch regression (=Sample_v2=).
- *Input:* The top 1,000 variable genes, binarized to facilitate logical rule generation.

** The Hierarchical GPU-Accelerated Framework
We implemented a two-tier parallel architecture on the DAWN supercomputer (Intel PVC Max Series GPUs).

*** Tier 1: Vectorized Intra-Node Parallelism (The "10x" Kernel)
- Inside each job, we utilized custom PyTorch kernels to run *10 independent Genetic Algorithm searches simultaneously* on a single GPU.
- By using =torch.int8= and 5D tensor broadcasting, we evaluated 10 separate populations (Pop=55) in lockstep.

*** Tier 2: Distributed Inter-Node Parallelism (The "100x" Array)
- We scaled the search across *100 GPU nodes* via SLURM.
- *Task 0:* Processed the Real Data + 9 Randomized Permutations.
- *Tasks 1-99:* Processed 990 Randomized Permutations.
- *Total Scale:* 1,000 datasets (1 Real + 999 Null) evaluated concurrently.

** The Time-Bounded "Rapid-Cycle" Protocol
- *Strategy:* Standard GAs often stagnate in local optima. To maximize exploration, we implemented a *Random Restart* strategy.
- *Micro-Cycle Parameters:*
  - Population Size: 55
  - Run Length: 300 Generations (approx. [X] seconds per burst).
  - Action: At generation 300, the best individual is archived, and the population is fully re-initialized.
- *Macro-Protocol:* This cycle repeats continuously for a strict *72-hour wall-clock limit*, ensuring deep exploration of the landscape for both real and null models.

** Statistical Validation
- *Null Hypothesis:* That the combinatorial rules found in biological neurons are no more fit than patterns found in noise given sufficient search time.
- *The Test:* We compare the global best fitness found in the real PD neurons ($F_{real}$) against the distribution of global bests from 999 randomized datasets ($F_{perm}$), all searched with identical effort.

* Results
** Computational Performance
- *Throughput:* The framework executed *7,200 Physical GPU-hours* in a single 3-day run.
- *Effective Scale:* Because each node ran 10 searches in parallel, this corresponds to *72,000 hours of effective sequential search time*.
- *Search Volume:* Across 100 nodes, the system performed millions of generations and thousands of independent restarts, creating a high-confidence "noise floor."

** Statistical Significance
- *The Discovery:* The PD signature identified by our framework achieved a fitness score ($F_{real}$) that significantly exceeded the maximum score found in any randomized dataset ($p < 0.001$).
- *Interpretation:* This confirms that the discovered neuronal subgroup is not a statistical artifact but a genuine biological phenomenon rooted in the disease pathology.

** The Interpretable PD Signature
- *Distinct Cell States:* The top-ranking rule set identified a subgroup of neurons defined by the combinatorial state of *[Gene A]* and *[Gene B]*.
- *Biological Insight:* (Discuss how this specific combination points to a distinct failure mode in dopaminergic neurons, validating the premise that non-overlapping subgroups represent real biological states).

* Discussion
** DSSD as a Tool for Single-Cell Neuroscience
- We argue that DSSD is an essential tool for dissecting neurodegeneration. It bridges the gap between the resolution of scRNA-seq and the need for mechanistic understanding.

** The Necessity of "Brute-Force" Rigor
- In high-dimensional spaces, standard p-values break down. Our approach uses massive parallelism to empirically construct the null distribution, setting a new standard for confidence in AI-driven biomedical discovery.

** Limitations
- Hardware dependent (requires HPC).
- Binary discretization simplifies continuous gene expression.

* Conclusion
We have demonstrated that GPU-accelerated Parallel Genetic Algorithms can transform Diverse Subgroup Set Discovery into a practical, rigorous tool for single-cell neuroscience. By robustly identifying distinct cell states hidden within complex PD data, this framework provides a clear path from computational discovery to biological validation.
