* Abstract
- Background :: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, yet scRNA-seq reveals high heterogeneity in cellular decline. Standard clustering often fails to resolve overlapping failure modes or distinguish disease-specific states from healthy stress responses.
- Methodology :: We applied Diverse Subgroup Set Discovery (DSSD) using a custom **Parallel Genetic Algorithm** on the DAWN HPC (Intel PVC GPUs). Unlike greedy algorithms, our framework evolves a set of rules simultaneously to maximize population coverage while minimizing redundancy. We validated findings using "Shadow Runs" (blinded re-discovery) and Differential Enrichment Analysis against background PD and Control populations.
- Rigor :: We addressed the "look-elsewhere" effect via a massive-scale permutation test, running 1,000 concurrent searches on real and randomized data (~72,000 GPU-hours equivalent).
- Results :: The framework identified a global solution with fitness statistically unreachable by chance ($p < 0.001$). This solution decomposed the PD population into three distinct, non-overlapping failure modes: (1) A **Metabolic Compensation** state defined by /NCOR2/ loss and mitochondrial upregulation; (2) An **Iron-Toxic** state defined by /FTH1/ and /CRYAB/-mediated stress; and (3) A **Fibrotic/Senescent** state defined by /PALD1/ and /LINGO1/ which is notably absent in healthy controls.
- Conclusion :: We demonstrate that GPU-accelerated evolutionary mining can robustly untangle the "mixed bag" of neurodegeneration into actionable, mechanistically distinct cell states.

* Introduction
** The Biological Challenge: The "Mixed Bag" of Neurodegeneration
Parkinson's Disease (PD) degeneration is asynchronous. At any given moment, the substantia nigra contains a mixture of healthy, compensating, and dying cells. Standard analysis pipelines typically rely on clustering (e.g., Louvain/Leiden), which forces cells into mutually exclusive groups based on global transcriptomic similarity. However, biological processes are often continuous or overlapping; a cell may possess a specific "Dopaminergic Identity" while simultaneously undergoing a specific "Metabolic Stress" state.

** The Computational Innovation: From Patient Stratification to Cellular States
Subgroup Discovery (SD) has a rich history in bioinformatics. In the microarray era, seminal works by **Gamberger et al. (2004)** and **Lavrač et al. (2004)** demonstrated that SD could find interpretable rules to stratify patients (e.g., /"Patients with high Gene X and low Gene Y have Leukemia Type A"/).

However, these early applications were limited by sample size ($N < 100$ patients) and focused on **classification** (Diagnosis). We repurpose this framework for the single-cell era, where $N$ is measured in thousands of cells. By treating individual cells as instances, we shift the focus from *Patient Stratification* to **Cell State Discovery**. We posit that non-overlapping subgroups in scRNA-seq data represent distinct, stable "attractor states" of cellular failure (e.g., Metabolic vs. Fibrotic) that co-exist within the same patient.

** Why DSSD? Optimizing Sets over Singletons
Applying SD to high-dimensional single-cell data creates a search space of $2^{1000}$ combinations. Standard "Top-$k$" algorithms are greedy: they return redundant variations of the single strongest signal (the "Table Mountain" effect). We implement **Diverse Subgroup Set Discovery (DSSD)** to optimize a *set* of rules simultaneously, penalizing overlap to force the discovery of orthogonal biological mechanisms.


* Methods
** Single-Cell Data Preprocessing
- *Dataset:* 6,385 dopaminergic neurons (Control vs. PD).
- *Input:* Top 1,000 variable genes, binarized to facilitate logical rule generation.

** The Hierarchical GPU-Accelerated Framework
To navigate the combinatorial search space, we developed a two-tier parallel Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimized for Intel PVC GPUs.

- *Tier 1 (Vectorized Intra-Node):* We utilize custom PyTorch kernels to evaluate 10 independent GA populations (Pop=55) simultaneously on a single GPU. By creating a dense tensor of size $[10 \times 55 \times 1000]$ and utilizing =int8= bit-packing, we achieve massive throughput for the boolean logic operations required by rule evaluation.
- *Tier 2 (Distributed Inter-Node):* The search is scaled across 100 GPU nodes. Task 0 processes the Real Data, while Tasks 1-99 process 999 randomized permutations to establish a rigorous null distribution.

** Fitness Function: Optimizing for Diversity
We employ a modified Weighted Relative Accuracy (WRAcc) that explicitly accounts for set diversity. The fitness $F$ of a chromosome (a set of $k$ rules) is defined as:

$$ F = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} WRAcc(Rule_i)}{1 + \lambda \cdot Overlap(Rule_1...Rule_k)} $$

Where $\lambda$ is a penalty factor for cells covered by multiple rules. This drives the evolutionary pressure towards finding **non-overlapping** cell states.

** Biological Characterization (Phase 1.5)
While the GA generates fully interpretable rule definitions (e.g., =PALD1=1=), we performed **Differential Enrichment Analysis (DEA)** to map these rules to broader pathobiological contexts:
1.  *Internal DEA:* Compared Subgroup PD cells vs. Background PD cells to identify specific "failure modes."
2.  *External DEA:* Compared Subgroup Control cells vs. Background Control cells to determine disease specificity.
3.  *Validation:* Gene lists were validated against the Gene Ontology (GO) database using =gseapy=.

* Results
** Computational & Statistical Performance
The framework executed a deep search equivalent to ~72,000 hours of sequential computation in <36 hours. The "Real Data" champion achieved a fitness of **0.0621**, while the maximum fitness found in 999 randomized datasets was **0.0294**.

** Biological Discovery: A Triple Dissociation of Failure Modes
The DSSD algorithm successfully decomposed the PD population into three robust, non-overlapping subgroups. The lack of overlap suggests these represent distinct "Attractor States" of cellular failure rather than a continuous gradient.

This back-to-back bar chart illustrates the number of Parkinson's Disease (PD, orange) and Control (CTRL, blue) cells covered by the top discovered rules. Rule 1 and Rule 2 identify highly specific minority populations, while Rule 4 captures a broader, yet still significantly enriched, PD subgroup.

*** 1. The Metabolic Compensation State (Rule 1)
- *Definition:* =NCOR2=0 AND MT-ND4L=1...=
- *Mechanism:* The loss of the nuclear repressor =NCOR2= co-occurs with a massive upregulation of Mitochondrial Complex I and IV subunits (=MT-ND4=, =MT-CO3=). This suggests a population under severe metabolic stress attempting to restore ATP deficits via transcriptional compensation.
- *Validation:* GO analysis confirmed enrichment for "Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Complex Assembly" ($p < 10^{-20}$).

*** 2. The Iron-Toxic Stress State (Rule 2)
- *Definition:* =FTH1=1 AND RBX1=0...=
- *Mechanism:* Defined by high Ferritin Heavy/Light Chain (=FTH1=, =FTL=). Crucially, this is the *only* subgroup that upregulates **=CRYAB=**, a heat-shock protein linked to alpha-synuclein aggregation protection. This distinguishes it as a state of active Iron Toxicity management.
- *Validation:* GO analysis confirmed "Cytoplasmic Translation" ($p < 0.001$), reflecting the high protein synthesis demand of Ferritin sequestration.

*** 3. The Fibrotic/Senescent State (Rule 4)
- *Definition:* =PALD1=1=
- *Mechanism:* This state is enriched for **=LINGO1=** (negative regulator of axonal repair) and extracellular matrix collagens (=COL27A1=).
- *Disease Specificity:* External DEA revealed that while =PALD1+= cells exist in healthy controls (marked by =RBFOX3=), the pathological markers =LINGO1= and =COL5A1= are **exclusive to the PD population**.
- *Validation:* GO analysis confirmed "Extracellular Matrix Organization" ($p < 10^{-8}$) and "Regulation of Small GTPase Signaling."

* Discussion
** Beyond the "Table Mountain"
A key challenge in Subgroup Discovery is the "Table Mountain" problem (van Leeuwen & Knobbe, 2012), where algorithms return redundant variations of the single strongest signal. By using DSSD with a diversity-aware fitness function, we forced the algorithm to step off the primary peak (likely Rule 4/Fibrosis) and discover the orthogonal Rule 1 (Metabolic) and Rule 2 (Iron) peaks.

This confirms that PD heterogeneity is not random noise, but a structured composition of distinct failure modes. The algorithm effectively "de-mixed" the transcriptomic signal into its constituent drivers.

** Therapeutic Implications
The clear separation of these states has profound implications for precision medicine:
- **Anti-LINGO1 therapies** (currently in trials) may only target the specific **Rule 4** sub-population ("Scarred Neurons").
- **Mitochondrial co-factors** would likely target the **Rule 1** population but may be ineffective for the **Rule 2** (Iron-Toxic) group, which requires chelation or aggregation inhibitors.

** Conclusion
We have demonstrated that GPU-accelerated Parallel Genetic Algorithms can transform Subgroup Discovery from a theoretical exercise into a rigorous biological tool. By robustly identifying distinct cell states hidden within complex PD data, this framework provides a clear map of the heterogeneous landscape of neurodegeneration.
