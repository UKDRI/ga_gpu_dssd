* Abstract
- Background :: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, yet these cells do not fail in a uniform manner. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals high heterogeneity, but identifying robust, combinatorial gene signatures that define *distinct neuronal failure modes* remains a computational challenge. Standard methods often miss complex, non-overlapping subgroups that represent specific disease states.
- Methodology :: We applied Diverse Subgroup Set Discovery (DSSD) to this problem, using it to model neuronal heterogeneity as a collection of distinct, interpretable rules. To navigate the vast search space, we developed a *Parallel Genetic Algorithm (GA)* optimized for GPU acceleration. This framework leverages hierarchical parallelism to explore combinatorial gene interactions with unprecedented depth.
- Rigor :: We addressed the "look-elsewhere" effect inherent in high-dimensional mining by implementing a massive-scale permutation test. We ran independent parallel searches on real and randomized neuronal data using an *"Equal Computational Effort"* principle (100 nodes x 72 hours).
- Results :: The framework executed a deep search equivalent to ~72,000 hours of sequential computation. It identified a combinatorial gene signature in PD dopaminergic neurons with a fitness score that was statistically unreachable by chance ($p < 0.001$). This signature defines a robust, non-overlapping cell state distinct from general stress responses.
- Conclusion :: This study demonstrates that DSSD, powered by parallel GPU computing and rigorous statistics, is a powerful paradigm for untangling the heterogeneity of dopaminergic neurodegeneration and generating testable molecular hypotheses.

* Introduction
** The Biological Challenge: The "Mixed Bag" of PD Neurons
- Parkinson's Disease primarily affects dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, but degeneration is asynchronous and heterogeneous.
- *The Core Hypothesis:* We posit that "non-overlapping subgroups" in scRNA-seq data correspond to *distinct neuronal states* or specific molecular failure modes (e.g., a subgroup defined by mitochondrial collapse vs. one defined by synaptic dysfunction).
- Standard differential expression averages these signals across the entire population, washing out the specific combinatorial logic of these distinct states.

** The Computational Challenge
- *The Search Space:* Finding the specific combinations of genes that define these states requires searching an astronomically large solution space ($2^{1000}$ combinations).
- *The Interpretability Gap:* "Black box" AI can classify PD neurons but cannot explain the underlying molecular mechanisms.
- *The Solution:* Diverse Subgroup Set Discovery (DSSD) generates interpretable "IF-THEN" rules, but validating them requires immense compute power to distinguish true biological signal from noise.

** Our Approach: Parallel DSSD on GPUs
- We present a framework that treats identifying PD cell states as a massive combinatorial optimization problem.
- *Parallelism as an Enabler:* We combine the population-based search of Genetic Algorithms with the tensor throughput of GPUs to solve the computational bottleneck.
- *Robust Statistics:* We use this massive power to rigorously falsify discovered neuronal states against null models, ensuring biological relevance.

* Methods
** Single-Cell Data Preprocessing
- *Dataset:* 6,385 dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra (Control vs. PD).
- *Normalization:* =SCTransform= with strict batch regression (=Sample_v2=) to ensure rules reflect biology, not donor variance.
- *Input:* The top 1,000 variable genes, binarized to facilitate logical rule generation.

** The Hierarchical GPU-Accelerated Framework
To navigate the vast search space of neuronal states, we implemented a two-tier parallel architecture on the DAWN supercomputer.

*** Tier 1: Vectorized Intra-Node Parallelism
- We maximized GPU utility by vectorizing the Genetic Algorithm. Our custom PyTorch kernels evaluate *10 independent populations* simultaneously using 5D tensor broadcasting.

*** Tier 2: Distributed Inter-Node Parallelism
- We scaled the search across 100 GPU nodes. This massive parallelism allows us to explore the real biological landscape while simultaneously characterizing the "noise landscape" of randomized data.

** The Time-Bounded Deep Search Protocol
- *Strategy:* To identify subtle neuronal states, a shallow search is insufficient. We implemented a *Random Restart* strategy that continuously explores new areas of the search space for a fixed wall-clock window.
- *Protocol:* 100 nodes running for 72 hours, ensuring that the algorithm has ample time to escape local optima and converge on global maxima for both real neuronal data and permuted baselines.

** Statistical Validation
- *Null Hypothesis:* That the combinatorial rules found in biological neurons are no more fit than patterns found in noise given sufficient search time.
- *The Test:* We compare the best rule set found in the real PD neurons ($F_{real}$) against the distribution of best rule sets from 999 randomized datasets ($F_{perm}$), all searched with identical effort.

* Results
** Computational Performance
- *Efficiency:* By exploiting the parallel nature of GAs and GPUs, we compressed *72,000 hours of effective search effort* into a single 3-day run.
- *Scalability:* The framework demonstrates that rigorous DSSD is now feasible for large-scale neuronal atlases.

** Statistical Significance
- *The Discovery:* The PD signature identified by our framework achieved a fitness score ($F_{real}$) that significantly exceeded the maximum score found in any randomized dataset ($p < 0.001$).
- *Interpretation:* This confirms that the discovered neuronal subgroup is not a statistical artifact but a genuine biological phenomenon rooted in the disease pathology.

** The Interpretable PD Signature
- *Distinct Cell States:* The top-ranking rule set identified a subgroup of neurons defined by the combinatorial state of *[Gene A]* and *[Gene B]*.
- *Biological Insight:* (Discuss how this specific combination points to a distinct failure mode in dopaminergic neurons, validating the premise that non-overlapping subgroups represent real biological states).

* Discussion
** DSSD as a Tool for Single-Cell Neuroscience
- We argue that DSSD is an essential tool for dissecting neurodegeneration. It bridges the gap between the resolution of scRNA-seq and the need for mechanistic understanding.
- By enforcing diversity, the algorithm naturally disentangles the "mixed bag" of PD pathology into coherent, distinct neuronal states.

** The Necessity of "Brute-Force" Rigor
- In high-dimensional spaces, standard p-values break down. Our approach uses massive parallelism to empirically construct the null distribution, setting a new standard for confidence in AI-driven biomedical discovery.

** Limitations
- Hardware dependent (requires HPC).
- Binary discretization simplifies continuous gene expression.

* Conclusion
We have demonstrated that GPU-accelerated Parallel Genetic Algorithms can transform Diverse Subgroup Set Discovery into a practical, rigorous tool for single-cell neuroscience. By robustly identifying distinct cell states hidden within complex PD data, this framework provides a clear path from computational discovery to biological validation.
