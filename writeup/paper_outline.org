* Abstract
- Background :: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, yet scRNA-seq reveals high heterogeneity in cellular decline. Standard clustering often fails to resolve overlapping failure modes or distinguish disease-specific states from healthy stress responses.
- Methodology :: We applied Diverse Subgroup Set Discovery (DSSD) using a custom **Parallel Genetic Algorithm** on the DAWN HPC (Intel PVC GPUs). Unlike greedy algorithms, our framework evolves a set of rules simultaneously to maximize population coverage while minimizing redundancy. We validated findings using "Shadow Runs" (blinded re-discovery) and Differential Enrichment Analysis against background PD and Control populations.
- Rigor :: We addressed the "look-elsewhere" effect via a massive-scale permutation test, running 1,000 concurrent searches on real and randomized data (~72,000 GPU-hours equivalent).
- Results :: The framework identified a global solution with fitness statistically unreachable by chance ($p < 0.001$). This solution decomposed the PD population into three distinct, non-overlapping failure modes: (1) A **Metabolic Compensation** state defined by /NCOR2/ loss and mitochondrial upregulation; (2) An **Iron-Toxic** state defined by /FTH1/ and /CRYAB/-mediated stress; and (3) A **Fibrotic/Senescent** state defined by /PALD1/ and /LINGO1/ which is notably absent in healthy controls.
- Conclusion :: We demonstrate that GPU-accelerated evolutionary mining can robustly untangle the "mixed bag" of neurodegeneration into actionable, mechanistically distinct cell states.

* Introduction
** The Biological Challenge: Gain of Dysfunction and Loss of Health
- Parkinson's Disease degeneration is asynchronous. At any moment, the tissue contains a mixture of healthy, compensating, and dying cells.
- *The Hypothesis:* We posit that "non-overlapping subgroups" in scRNA-seq data correspond to distinct **failure modes**.
- Standard differential expression averages these signals. For example, if 30% of cells have high Iron and 30% have high Fibrosis, averaging them dilutes both signals. DSSD isolates these signals into discrete rules.

** The Computational Definition: What is a Subgroup?
- We define a "Subgroup Description" as a high-order combinatorial rule (e.g., =Gene A=1 AND Gene B=0 AND Gene C=1=).
- A subgroup is "interesting" if the distribution of disease labels (PD vs. CTRL) within the subset deviates significantly from the global population.

** Why DSSD? Optimizing Sets over Singletons
- Standard algorithms are greedy, finding many variations of the same strongest rule ("Table Mountain" redundancy).
- *Set Optimization:* Our fitness function evaluates a *chromosome of multiple rules*. It heavily penalizes overlap, forcing the GA to find *distinct* biological mechanisms rather than just the largest one.

* Methods
** Single-Cell Data Preprocessing
- *Dataset:* 6,385 dopaminergic neurons (Control vs. PD).
- *Input:* Top 1,000 variable genes, binarized to facilitate logical rule generation.

** The Hierarchical GPU-Accelerated Framework
- *Tier 1 (Vectorized):* Custom PyTorch kernels run 10 independent GA populations (Pop=55) simultaneously on a single GPU using =int8= tensor broadcasting.
- *Tier 2 (Distributed):* Scaled across 100 GPU nodes. Task 0 processed Real Data; Tasks 1-99 processed 999 Permutations.

** Biological Characterization (Phase 1.5)
To interpret the "Black Box" rules found by the GA, we performed **Differential Enrichment Analysis (DEA)**:
1.  *Internal DEA:* Compared Subgroup PD cells vs. Background PD cells to identify state-specific markers.
2.  *External DEA:* Compared Subgroup Control cells vs. Background Control cells to test for disease specificity.
3.  *Pathway Validation:* Enriched gene lists were validated against the Gene Ontology (GO) database using =gseapy=.

* Results
** Computational & Statistical Performance
- The framework executed a deep search equivalent to ~72,000 hours of sequential computation in <36 hours.
- *Significance:* The "Real Data" champion achieved a fitness of **0.0621**, while the maximum fitness found in 999 randomized datasets was **0.0294**.
- *Conclusion:* The discovered structure is statistically significant ($p < 0.001$) and cannot be generated by noise.

** Biological Discovery: A Triple Dissociation of Failure Modes
The GA identified three robust, non-overlapping subgroups representing distinct cellular states.

*** 1. The Metabolic Compensation State (Rule 1)
- *Definition:* =NCOR2=0 AND FAM19A5=0 AND MT-ND4L=1...=
- *Enrichment:* These cells exhibit massive upregulation of Mitochondrial Complex I and IV subunits (=MT-ND4=, =MT-CO3=, =MT-ATP6=).
- *Mechanism:* The loss of the nuclear repressor =NCOR2= appears to trigger a compensatory transcriptional program to restore ATP deficits.
- *Validation:* Gene Ontology analysis confirmed enrichment for "Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Complex Assembly" ($p < 10^{-20}$) and "Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy."

*** 2. The Iron-Toxic Stress State (Rule 2)
- *Definition:* =FTH1=1 AND RBX1=0...=
- *Enrichment:* Defined by high Ferritin Heavy Chain (=FTH1=) and Light Chain (=FTL=). Crucially, these cells uniquely express **Alpha-Crystallin B (=CRYAB=)**, a heat-shock protein linked to alpha-synuclein aggregation protection.
- *Mechanism:* Unlike healthy iron-rich cells, these PD cells exhibit a specific stress response (=CRYAB=, =HSP90=) indicative of iron toxicity.
- *Validation:* GO analysis confirmed "Cytoplasmic Translation" ($p < 0.001$), reflecting the high protein synthesis demand of Ferritin sequestration.

*** 3. The Fibrotic/Senescent State (Rule 4)
- *Definition:* =PALD1=1=
- *Enrichment:* Enriched for **=LINGO1=** (negative regulator of axonal repair) and extracellular matrix collagens (=COL27A1=, =COL5A1=).
- *Disease Specificity:* While =PALD1+= cells exist in healthy controls (marked by =RBFOX3=), the pathological markers =LINGO1= and =COL5A1= are **exclusive to the PD population**.
- *Mechanism:* This represents a "terminal" state where neurons have ceased repair efforts and are actively scarring the extracellular environment.
- *Validation:* GO analysis confirmed "Extracellular Matrix Organization" ($p < 10^{-8}$) and "Regulation of Small GTPase Signaling."

* Discussion
** Deconstructing the "Mixed Bag"
Standard analysis pools these cells together. Our results demonstrate that "PD Neurons" are not a monolith. At any given time, a neuron might be fighting a Metabolic battle (Rule 1), suffering Iron Toxicity (Rule 2), or surrendering to Senescence/Fibrosis (Rule 4).

** Therapeutic Implications
- *Rule 4 (Fibrosis)* suggests that anti-LINGO1 therapies may only target a specific sub-population (the "scarred" neurons).
- *Rule 1 (Metabolic)* suggests a distinct population that might benefit from mitochondrial co-factors, which would be ineffective for the Iron-Toxic group.

** Conclusion
We have demonstrated that GPU-accelerated Parallel Genetic Algorithms can transform Subgroup Discovery from a theoretical exercise into a rigorous biological tool. By robustly identifying distinct cell states hidden within complex PD data, this framework provides a clear map of the heterogeneous landscape of neurodegeneration.
